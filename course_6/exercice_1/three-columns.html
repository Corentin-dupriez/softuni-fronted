    <h1>Three laws of robotics</h1> 
    <p class="description top-text">Rules developed by science-fiction writer Isaac Asimov, who sought to create an ethical system for humans and robots.</p>
    <div class="laws-container">
     <div class="law">
        <h4>1st Law</h4> 
        <p>A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm</p>
      </div> 
     <div class="law">
        <h4>2nd Law</h4> 
        <p>A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm</p>
      </div> 
     <div class="law">
        <h4>3rd Law</h4> 
        <p>A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law</p>
      </div> 
    </div>
    <p class="description bottom-text">Asimov later added another rule, known as the fourth or zeroth law, that superseded the others. It stated that <span class="quote">“a robot may not harm humanity, or, by inaction, allow humanity to come to harm.”</span></p>
